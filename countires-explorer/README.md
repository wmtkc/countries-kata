# Dev Comments
I took a good amount of time on this, so I think I was able to implement most of the behavior I wanted. If I took more time, I'd probably focus on making it look nicer, especially regarding edge cases in the data (like Antarctica's timezones). I'd also add some stateful behavior like the suggested "favorites" function and store that in local storage.
